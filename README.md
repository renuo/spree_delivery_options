Spree Delivery Options
=================

This gem is a fork from [spree_delivery_date](from 'https://github.com/sgringwe/spree_delivery_date'), and it has been updated to work with spree_core 2.1.3, as well as other changes. 

Requires user to enter a delivery date and delivery time during checkout (delivery section).

Features
-------

* Delivery date validation
	* Creates a cut off time for deliveries done the day after
	* If order is being done before cut off time, delivery date can be set to the day after
	* If order is after cut off time, delivery date can only be set to the day after + 1

* Shows delivery date and time during checkout confirmation.
* Shows delivery date when viewing or editing order as admin.
* Allows admin to filter orders by delivery date and time (date range).
* Allows admin to sort orders by delivery date and time.
* Adds delivery date column to orders index page table.


Installation
------------

Add the gem to your Gemfile

    $ gem 'spree_delivery_options'

bundle with
  
    $ bundle update

and run

        }.to_json

      end
